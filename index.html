        <p>Thanks for checking out my website! My name is Lilith (as you've probably figured out already) and I am an undergraduate
        at Indian Hills Community College in Ottumwa Iowa. Right now, I'm pursuing my associates degree
        in computer software development, and I'm always learning new things while I'm here. I plan to update this website as I progress through college
            to add to my list of skills, past projects, and fields of work I'm competent in.
            </p>
